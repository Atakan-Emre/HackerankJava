# HackerRank Java Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Java programming challenges on HackerRank.

## Introduction

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) is a platform that provides competitive programming challenges across various domains. The Java domain includes challenges to test your knowledge and skills in Java programming. This repository includes my solutions to these challenges.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- The name of each folder corresponds to the name of a challenge or an exercise.
- Each folder contains a `README.md` file with the problem description.
- The Java solution is within a `.java` file with the same name as the folder.

## Running the Solutions

Each solution can be compiled and run using the Java compiler (`javac`) and the Java interpreter (`java`), respectively:

```bash
javac Solution.java
java Solution
```

## Contributing
